# BREAKOUT!

This was a project for my computer hardware class. It runs on an Arduino Uno, and uses an Adafruit TFT LCD display (do not recommend, btw). It also uses an analog thumbstick.  
It depends on my `GFX_Math` library, since I was originally trying to make a 3D renderer. The screen ended up being too slow for that.

## Features
- "Animated" Title Screen
- 5 Levels
- Pausing
